# Branch Tree

A minimalist 2D generative branching tree on a black background.

- Green neon branches
- Random branching
- Random branch termination (some branches stop growing)
- Click to plant one tree exactly at the cursor
- Slow self-reproduction via occasional seed drops
- Heritable growth traits with small mutations each generation

## Run

From repo root:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:3000/branch-tree/`
